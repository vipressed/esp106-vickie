## This is the lab for week 2 
## Add working R code in between the questions
## The functions refer to the sections in https://rspatial.org/intr/

## Functions

## 1) Write a function 'f' that behaves like this:
## > f('Jim')
## [1] "hello Jim, how are you?"
##HINT: you will need to use the paste() function within your new function
f <- function(Jim) {return('"hello Jim, how are you?"')}

## 2) Write a function 'sumOfSquares' that behaves like this:


## > d <- c(1,5,2,4,6,2,4,5)
## > sumOfSquares(d)
## [1] 21.875

# To compute the "sum of squares", subtract the mean value of all numbers from each number. 
# Square these numbers and sum them
# (bonus: make a variant that can handle NAs)
sumOfSquares <- function(x) {sum((x-mean(x))^2)}

## Flow Control

## 4) Write a for loop that adds the numbers 1 to 10
##HINT: you will need one variable that loops through the numbers 1 to 10 and one that keeps count through each loop
total <- 0
for (i in seq(1:10)){total <- total +i}
total


## 5) Write a for loop that adds the odd numbers between 1 and 10 

total <- 0
for (i in seq(1,9,2)){total <- total +i}
total
